# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains most basic algorithms and data structures using generic method implemenation in c ,which provides unittest , functional, time complexity tests for them to guarantee that there are less obvious bugs  .

## Introduction
There are a lot of useful references for the implementations . Here is the reference list which helps me a lot .
