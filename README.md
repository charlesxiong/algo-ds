# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains most basic algorithms and data structures using generic method implemenation in c , which provides unit testing , functional and time complexity tests for them to guarantee that there are less obvious bugs  .

## Introduction
There are a lot of useful references for the implementations . Here is the reference list which helps me a lot .
- [Algorithms,4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
- [List of data structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)
- [The lesser known but useful data structures](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/500607/what-are-the-lesser-known-but-useful-data-structures?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top)
- [The Archive of Interesting Code](http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/)
- [NOCOW](http://www.nocow.cn/index.php/NOCOW%E5%9C%B0%E5%9B%BE)
